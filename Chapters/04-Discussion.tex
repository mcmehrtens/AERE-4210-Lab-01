The results produced by Ansys seem to match engineering intuition and pass boundary condition verification. While performing the analysis, it was very important to use consistent units—base SI units, in this case—since Ansys does not perform unit conversions for the user. Additionally, it was necessary to fully constrain the problem. When solving problems on paper, assumptions like ``no displacement in the $z$ direction'' are often taken for granted but must be specified to Ansys.
