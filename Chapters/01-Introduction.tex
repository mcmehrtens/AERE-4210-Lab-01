Ansys is a finite element solver that can be used for many types of modeling. In this lab assignment, Ansys was introduced as a way of performing structural analysis for a simply supported truss. The objective was to complete calculations for the displacement of each node, the reaction forces at nodes \numlist{1;3}, and the forces, stresses, and volume in each element. In comparison to solving by hand, this software can provide a much faster and extremely accurate way of solving various structural problems.
